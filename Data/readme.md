# Well Log Visualization using FORCE 2020 Dataset

## Project Overview

This mini project focuses on quick visualization and analysis of well log data using the FORCE 2020 Lithology Prediction Dataset. The project is designed to help petroleum engineering students, geoscientists, and data science learners understand subsurface formations through common petrophysical logs.

The visualization includes:

- Gamma Ray (GR)
- Resistivity Logs (RSHA, RMED, RDEP)
- Bulk Density (RHOB)
- Neutron Porosity (NPHI)

This project also serves as a foundation for future machine learning applications such as lithology prediction and electrofacies classification.

# Dataset Information

## Lithology Prediction Dataset (FORCE 2020)

This dataset contains well log data for predicting lithology (rock type) from various geophysical measurements. It was developed as part of the FORCE 2020 Lithology Prediction Competition and is widely used for machine learning and subsurface interpretation studies.

The dataset includes:

- Well log measurements
- Geological formations
- Lithology labels
- Spatial well information
- Confidence scores for lithology predictions
